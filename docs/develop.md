### Tasks

1.  Codebase

    1.  set up repository with hooks and data set grabbing

    2.  data-set:
        <https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/03/language-detection-using-natural-language-processing/>

    3.  or larger data set: <https://zenodo.org/record/841984>

    4.  n-grams: <http://cloudmark.github.io/Language-Detection/>

    5.  can use bigram or trigram approach but will not work so well on
        short phrases

    6.  check if out of place error is the same as normalized vector
        difference norm, but show it empirically can work

    7.  can use numpy and sklearn for basic operations such as vector
        comparisons and accuracy/f1 scores

2.  Presentation

    1.  prepare 5 slides within 15 minutes for HSLU interview

    2.  motivate structure of language with basic commentary and how
        this works

    3.  mention older articles use data more wisely -\> eg. of BPE paper
        from before

    4.  mention usage of modern techniques ommitted due to no libraries
        allowed

    5.  cite and describe classical problem -\> use
        `Cavnar and Trenkle (1994)`

    6.  them mention new NN approaches to handle short phrases where
        language profiles may not be built up as yet

    7.  heavy solution could also be a large word level vocabulary which
        can handle everything -\> would actually be ideal if possible
