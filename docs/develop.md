### Tasks

1.  Prediction

    1.  **TODO** add two separate inputs for predicting on
        test and on new file, with --evaluate flag

    2.  **TODO** add edge case in case no language is
        detected for all zeros -\> then it should show a warning and
        default to something for evaluation protocols

2.  Coding style

    1.  add nice bash scripts for all functions

    2.  n-grams: <http://cloudmark.github.io/Language-Detection/>

3.  Presentation

    1.  prepare 5 slides within 15 minutes for HSLU interview

    2.  motivate structure of language with basic commentary and how
        this works -\> find citations

    3.  mention older articles use data more wisely -\> eg. of BPE paper
        from before

    4.  mention usage of modern techniques ommitted due to no libraries
        allowed

    5.  cite and describe classical problem -\> use
        `Cavnar and Trenkle (1994)`

    6.  them mention new NN approaches to handle short phrases where

    7.  heavy solution could also be a large word level vocabulary which
        can handle everything -\> would actually be ideal if possible

    8.  skip punctuation removal -\> explain why it might be problematic
