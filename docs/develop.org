** Notes
*** Tasks
**** Prediction
***** TODO add two separate inputs for predicting on test and on new file, with --evaluate flag
***** TODO add edge case in case no language is detected for all zeros -> then it should show a warning and default to something for evaluation protocols

**** Coding style
***** add nice bash scripts for all functions
***** n-grams: http://cloudmark.github.io/Language-Detection/
      
**** Presentation
***** prepare 5 slides within 15 minutes for HSLU interview
***** motivate structure of language with basic commentary and how this works -> find citations
***** mention older articles use data more wisely -> eg. of BPE paper from before
***** mention usage of modern techniques ommitted due to no libraries allowed
***** cite and describe classical problem -> use ~Cavnar and Trenkle (1994)~
***** them mention new NN approaches to handle short phrases where language profiles may not be built up as yet
***** heavy solution could also be a large word level vocabulary which can handle everything -> would actually be ideal if possible      
***** skip punctuation removal -> explain why it might be problematic for different languages
