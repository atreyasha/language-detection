** Notes
*** Tasks
**** Motivation
***** structure of language with importance of morphology: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics
***** mention older articles use data more wisely -> interesting workarounds
***** mention usage of modern techniques ommitted due to no libraries allowed -> keep things simple like in the older days
***** mention data set used for evaluation since nothing was provided -> 235 languages with 235,000 paragraphs + balanced data set

**** Workflow
***** cite and describe classical problem -> use ~Cavnar and Trenkle (1994)~
***** mention why using words was not so easy and why character n-grams were preferred -> generalization due to morphology
***** mention lowercasing and removal of special tokens and digits for noise removal
***** use pseudocode to describe problem-solving process and mention hyperparameters
***** if possible, show some examples of morphology captured which could be interesting

**** Limitations and workaround
***** problematic on short phrases due to lack of morphology profiles being built up -> new NN approaches to handle short phrases -> cite if possible
***** heavy solution could also be a large word level vocabulary which can handle everything -> would actually be ideal if possible 
***** mention word level strategy and challenges with non Latin scripts -> hard to split in all cases
***** talk about efficiency and other techniques as further work

**** Admin
***** prepare maximum 5 slides within 15 minutes for HSLU interview
